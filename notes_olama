Got it‚Äîyou're aiming to **bundle the Ollama model files directly into your production image** (like a Docker image) and serve them from a static location such as:

```
C:\Users\Pro\Desktop\Ayodele\25062025\myproject\media\local_models\Ollama
```

That‚Äôs totally doable, but there are a few key things to keep in mind:

---

### üß± 1. **Include the Model Files in Your Build**
Once you've downloaded the model using:

```bash
ollama run llama3
```

Ollama stores the model files in its default cache (usually under `~/.ollama/models`). You‚Äôll want to **copy those files** into your project directory:

```bash
# Example (adjust paths as needed)
cp -r ~/.ollama/models C:\Users\Pro\Desktop\Ayodele\25062025\myproject\media\local_models\Ollama
```

---

### üê≥ 2. **Reference the Local Model in Your Dockerfile or Runtime**
In your Dockerfile or production startup script, set the environment variable:

```Dockerfile
ENV OLLAMA_MODELS=/app/media/local_models/Ollama
```

Or in Python (if you're launching Ollama from code):

```python
import os
os.environ["OLLAMA_MODELS"] = "/app/media/local_models/Ollama"
```

Make sure your Docker image or production server has the Ollama binary installed and can access that path.

---

### üöÄ 3. **Run Ollama from the Local Model**
If you‚Äôve created a custom model using a `Modelfile`, you can run it like this:

```bash
ollama create my-model -f /app/media/local_models/Ollama/Modelfile
ollama run my-model
```

Or if you're just using a prebuilt model like LLaMA 3, and it's already in that folder, Ollama will detect it automatically when you run:

```bash
ollama run llama3
```

---

### üß† Heads-Up
- Ollama still needs to be installed in the production environment (it‚Äôs not just the model files).
- You can‚Äôt run Ollama purely from static files‚Äîit‚Äôs a binary that must be executed.
- If you're deploying to a cloud server, make sure the model path is mounted or copied during deployment.

---

If you‚Äôd like, I can help you write a Dockerfile that installs Ollama, copies your model files, and runs everything in one go. Want to go that route?
